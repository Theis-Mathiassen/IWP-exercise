   The first series of functions are called by the server module as result of HTTP
   communication with the client caused by the user submitting forms.
   Forms Data is transfered to this "application" module, it two steps:
  1) The raw forms data is sent to a validator functions that retuns a  validated data-object with the forms data.
  2) Then, the now validated data is forwarded to a function that computes the actual client response (HTML page).
